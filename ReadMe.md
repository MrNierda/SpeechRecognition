# Voice assistant

Based on [this page](https://www.codespeedy.com/voice-assistant-with-python/)

Use the following package
* PyAudio
* SpeechRecognition
* PyYaml
* [Parametrized](https://pypi.org/project/parameterized/)

Could not use a virtual environnement (the install of PyAudio never succeeded).
The speech recognition is not perfect (could come from my mic, or from my pronunciation).

## The gain
* Learned about speech recognition
* Successfully parametrized python test (should still look on how to parametrize with PyTest)
* Reading a yaml file, and work with the content
* A bit of use of the webbrowser package
